### History of exchange

#### Barter

All products are bound by offer and demand.
Their price fluctuates as much as they're required by the consumer.

The market moves through and from fear and greed. Basically **FOMO**

As the market flowed a simple piece-by-piece barter was changed into a product-standard.
This product was gold.
As a standard all barters were standardized into a gold-based value.

After, it evolved to coin-based value, then paper value and then FIAT.
_FIAT_ are currencies issued by the government,
and are not backed by a physical commodity such as gold.

With this inclusion and control,
exchanges were turned then into plastic money, and then electronic.

- What backs the dollar?
  - Nothing so far.

During the pandemic,
the solution thought after to solve the impending crisis was to _print_ more money.

#### Barter and bitcoin

- Good
  - A barter is the most simple form of exchanging value
  - Only practical in small circles
  - The bigger the market, more difficult to control
  - It isn't affected by market fluctuations and/or de-valuations.
  - No intermediaries
  - Non-taxable
- Bad
  - Lack of scale coincidence
  - Lack of temporary line.
    - What if i don't have the ripe apples yet?
  - Lack of location coincidence
- All three previous solved by bitcoin?
  - Apparently yes
